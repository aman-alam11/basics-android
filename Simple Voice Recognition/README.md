# simpleVoiceRecognitionAndroid
ANDROID: VOICE. 
Developed a single screen simple application that takes user's voice input and returns the top 3 results according to the highest 3 confidence score. 
Took this extra initiative as a part of CS 5520 Mobile Application Development to explain everyone to use Google's voice interaction
and voice recognition api. Gave a presentation on Voice recognition and used this simple application to display its working.

The app opens up with a mike icon where user can click and speak anything

The app returns with the top 3 results along with their confidence scores. In this screen, I said "I love Android" and these are the results.
We can use confidence scores to refine the filter the results. But a higher confidence score does not means, it is more correct in all scenarios.
