         Normally, when only enterAlways is used, the Toolbar will continue to expand as you scroll down.
        Assuming enterAlways is declared and you have specified a minHeight,
        you can also specify enterAlwaysCollapsed. When this setting is used,
        your view will only appear at this minimum height.
        Only when scrolling reaches to the top will the view expand to its full height

    <string name="random_text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting
        , remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</string>
